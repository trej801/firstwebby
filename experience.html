                        <p>My first job ever was flipping burgers at Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers. From there I've worked in construction, sales, youth mentoring, mortgage lending, and more.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Sales</h2>
                        <p>The skill that I've had the most time working on is sales. I've done door to door sales in more than 10 states. I've directly sold services to more than 400+ customers. Through all this experience what I've learned some valueable lessons and skills about sales. I've learned that sales is simply understanding the value of your product/service. What problem does it solve? How does it help people?</p>
                        <p>After that you need to understand who benefits from your offering. Sales shouldn't be pushy. When you know who can actully benefit from what your selling and you master communicating that value then sales is a natural process. This doesn't mean that it's not hard or uncomfortable in certain scenerios, but it becomes much more enjoyable.</p>
                        <p>I've developed the skill of being able to break down products/services to easliy understand benefits. I understand target markets and can develop pitches to approach customers. I've also developed the skill of effective communicaiton. I know how to help people feel comortable in a conversation and how to communicate value and close.</p>

                        <p>In 2023 I started working in the mortgage industry. I started off doing sales for someone else but soon decided to get my own license and become a mortgage broker. Since getting my license I've closed nearly 2 million in real estate assets. </p>

                        <p>As I've worked in the mortgage industry I've learned several new skills. I've learned the basics of common loan products and what lenders are looking for in a prospective borrower. I've learned how to price a loan and what documents are needed to close one. I've learned how to find clients and build a consistant pipeline. </p>
